# Project: LLM-Based Recipe Generator and Nutrition Analyzer

## Description
This project involves creating a Python application that uses a Language Learning

Model (LLM) to generate cooking recipes based on user-specified ingredients and
dietary preferences.

The application will not only suggest recipes but also analyse their nutritional content,
offering health insights and modifications to fit dietary needs (e.g., low-carb, vegan).

Students will work on integrating LLM for recipe generation, and a user interface for
inputting preferences and displaying recipes and their nutritional facts.

SW / HW: SW

Program Suitability: Software Development, Data Science

Input: A user-friendly interface where users can specify ingredients on hand, dietary
restrictions, and nutritional preferences.

Example:
Ingredients: they have chicken breast, spinach, and tomatoes;

Dietary preference: low-carb

Goal: muscle gain.

Output: Utilizing an LLM to process inputs and generate creative, tailored recipes.

Breaking down the nutritional content of each recipe. Offering alternatives or
modifications to recipes to meet specific dietary needs, such as substituting ingredients
for allergy-friendly options or adjusting quantities for calorie control.

Provide the option for the user to play the generated recipe as audio.

Example:

Recipe: The application generates a recipe for "Grilled Chicken Breast with Spinach-
Tomato Salad."

Nutrition facts: It provides a breakdown of the recipe's nutritional content, highlighting
its high protein content suitable for muscle gain and low carbohydrate level.

Suggestions: It suggests substituting traditional dressing with an olive oil and lemon
juice dressing to reduce carbs further and enhance flavour.
